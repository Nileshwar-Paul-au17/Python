'''
Consider an NÃ—N grid. Rows of the grid are numbered from 1 to N and columns are also numbered from 1 to N.
Cell present at row i and column j is denoted by ( i , j ).
Top left cell is ( 1 , 1 ) and bottom most cell is ( N , N ).
Some cells are blocked and some cells are empty. if cell ( i , j ) contains " * ", then it is blocked and you cannot move into that cell. If the cell is empty then cell ( i , j ) will be ".".

Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left square to the lower-right square such that no path crosses through any blocked cell.
You only can move right or down.
Print the number of paths modulo 109+7.
In othe words, if number of paths is K (could be a very large integer), print k%M where M=1000000007.

Input Format

The first input line has an integer N: the size of the grid.

After this, there are N lines that describe the grid. Each line has N characters: "." denotes an empty cell, and " * " denotes a trap.

Constraints

1 <= N <=1000
Output Format

Print the number of paths modulo 109+7.

Since , the top left cell is blocked , Number of paths from (1,1) to (N,N) will be zero
