'''
You are given an array A of size N consiting of N positive integers.
A subarray is called monotonic if every element of the subarray is strictly greater than the the previous(immediate left) element.
In other words, a subarray [ A[i] , A[i+1] , ... , A[j] ] is monotonic if for all k where i < k <= j, A[k] >A[k-1]. Note that a subarray of size 1 is monotonic.

Find the largest possible sum of a monotonic subarray.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous sequence of numbers in an array.

Expected Complexity: O(n)
Input Format

The first input line has one integers N (Number of elements of the array)
The next line has N space seperated integers i,e A[0],A[1] ,â€¦ ,A[N-1]
Constraints

1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i] <= 100
Output Format

Print a single integer in one line

Sample Input 0

6
10 20 30 5 10 50
Sample Output 0

65
Explanation 0

[5,10,50] is the monotonic subarray with the maximum sum of 65.
