'''
You are given an array A consisting of N positive integers.
You can shuffle the array A in any way.
After that , you can create a new array B of length N where B[i]=(A[i] + i)%2 , for each i (1 <= i<= N).

Find the maximum possible sum of integers of the array B if you shuffle A optimally.
NOTE:
% represents the modulo operation.

Input Format

The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A[1],A[2] ,â€¦, A[N].
Constraints

1 <=T <=10000
1 <=N <=100000
1 <= A[i] <=10000000
Output Format

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum sum of integers of the array B.

Sample Input 0

1 2 3
Sample Output 0

2
Explanation 0

One of the optimal ways to shuffle the array A is [2,1,3]. Then the array B=[(2+1)%2,(1+2)%2,(3+3)%2]=[1,1,0]. So the sum of integers of array B is 2. This is the maximum possible sum we can achieve
